public class LongestSubsequenceString {
    /*
    *
    * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
            A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

            For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
            A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

            Example 1:

            Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
            Example 2:

            Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
            Example 3:

            Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
            Output: 0
            Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
